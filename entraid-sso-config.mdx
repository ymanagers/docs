description: "Use Entra ID as identity provider (IdP) for a seamless login"

Entra ID (formerly known as Azure AD) is a robust and secure cloud identity platform used by many organizations.

Entra ID integration provides Single Sign-On (SSO) capacity:

- Users create a single set of credentials with Entra ID
- Entra ID lets users log in to many applications, including Y Managers, with these credentials
- Entra ID keeps users' login details separate from their Y Managers usage data

Entra ID never "sees" or records what happens in Y Managers application. The Entra ID integration only provides access to their Y Managers account. Adding Entra ID as a login option means Y Managers admins can manage users in a centralized location.

Y Managers is using a, what is called, "multi-tenant" application configuration, which allows users from any Entra ID to authenticate to Y Managers without the need for the organization to register an "enterprise application" in own Entra ID tenant. Howerver, there is still a need to register an application to allow Y Managers to verify domain ownership by pulling the domain names registered in organization's Entra ID.

## Required Permissions

**Entra ID** - Any user with application management permission (Global Admin, Application Admin)
**Y Managers** - Any user with "Admin" system role

7. Click the switches to enable using one or more domains for your organization

### Custom login URL

Your organization's custom SSO login URL is shown on the Y Managers SSO administration page. Once you enable SSO for your organization, users should be directed to this URL. On the login page you will now see a **Login with Microsoft** button.

![entra-custom-loginpage](/images/entra-custom-loginpage.png)


The user can click on this button and log in using their Entra ID/Office365 credentials.

When **SSO Only** switch is enabled in the administration page, the user will not have an option to click the **Login with Microsoft** button, but instead will automatically be redirected to login with Microsoft.

_Note: In both cases non-SSO user, such as organization Admins can log in using local login credentials (username/password) either on the custom organization login page, or generic login page _[_https://ymanagers.com/login_](https://ymanagers.com/login)_._
